"""Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.
For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)"""


Number = int(input('What\'s your number ?--> '))

list=[(x) for x in range(1,45) if Number % x == 0]

print(list)
